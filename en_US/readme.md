# Introduction

Both itnig and Delvy have worked hard to summarize in [this document](../en_US/theitnigagreement.md) all the accumulated learning that we have gained from the many people who have helped and advised us over the last few years.

The result is **the itnig agreement**, a partnership proposal that aims to respect the entrepreneursâ€™ rights, and in which  major and critical aspects are explained in clear and plain English to ensure transparency between parties.

There are three types of comments:

- **Critical Point**: A very important factor that must be carefully considered by entrepreneurs.

- **Explanation**: A clarification of a confusing point in plain English.

- **Legal Procedure**: An explanation of the legal procedures that could arise from the signing of this shareholders agreement.
